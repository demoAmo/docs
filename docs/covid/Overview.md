## Welcome to the COVID19 Surviellance Tool

### Overview

The COVID19 Surveillance system can be found here: [http://hmis.gov.ls/covid19](http://hmis.gov.ls/covid19)

This system is built off of DHIS2's Tracker Module. All of the broader user manuals can be found [here:](https://dhis2.github.io/dhis2-docs/master/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en.html)

In addition to that, we have developed guidelines specific to our context and usecases. The document structure looks like this:

```
<COVID-19>
└── Overview
        ├── Overview
└── Data Consumption Guidelines
        ├── Indicators
└── Data Entry Guidelines
        ├── Using Web
        └── Using Mobile
```
